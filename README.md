cd mcp-fathom-server
npm install
npm run build
```

2. **Configure your API key**:

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Fathom API key
```

3. **Get your Fathom API key**:
   - Log in to [Fathom](https://app.fathom.video)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fathom": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-fathom-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FATHOM_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Restart Claude Desktop** and you're ready to go! 🎉

## 💬 Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude natural language questions about your meetings:

```
"Find me meetings about recruiting"
"Show me all external meetings from last week"  
"Search for meetings where we discussed product launches"
"List meetings with john@example.com"
"Find meetings with action items about hiring"
"What did we discuss in our Q1 planning meetings?"
```

Claude will automatically choose the right tool and search method based on your query.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Server won't start** | Check that your API key is correctly set |
